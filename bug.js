This bug occurs when using the Expo CLI to build an Android app.  The error message is cryptic and unhelpful, often mentioning issues with the Android build system without providing specific guidance. It can manifest as a failure to build the APK, resulting in a build process termination without a clear reason. This commonly happens after making seemingly small changes to the codebase or when integrating new packages.  The problem is intermittent and hard to debug due to inconsistent error reporting.  The error is different each time and may be related to a dependency.
